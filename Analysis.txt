Lets just start with a little overview of whats going on here. In the GitHub repository you will
find two python files, two images, this txt file, and two kml files. Each python file is exists to
create a visual using matplotlib with the data from the sets. One is of "Deer wintering" areas, and the other shows the areas where wildlife management is practiced. The focus is to see if there is any visual correlation between wildlife management and the prevalence of deer populations. The two kml files are used to standardize the state border, and county borders across the two visualizations. We can see that there is a large portion of northern Maine with little to no data present. We also see overlap between the data from the deer wintering and wildlife management areas. This appears to be a correlation but it is hard to tell without more information. Two theories I have are that elevations may have something to do with this as areas with more mountains seem to have less available data. I also wonder if there is simply less data in these areas that are less populated. An elevation map, and a population map could help draw some conclusions from these theories. Another area to explore would be data on public funding or tax incomes to see if there are any correlations between funding and data existing. This could help shed more light on weather or not there is reason to believe there is missing data. Deer are one of many species that are actively monitored, and some insight into the populations of other animals could give more credibility to the correlation between population and management if it is concluded that there isn't a significant amount of missing data.
